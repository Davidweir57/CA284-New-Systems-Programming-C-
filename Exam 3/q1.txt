Using pointers and a block of memory allows us to dynamically allocate memory to store all of the int items. We would use this in instances
where we do not know the maximum lenght our array must be (how many elements there needs to be). This ensures memory is only allocated if it is
needed ,preventing any waste of memory, and that we still have enough memory to store all of the items. We then use pointers to our array to
manage each int item individually.

Declaring an array at compile time risks allocating memory that will not be used or not allocating enough memory to store all of the required
int items.

Examples:
    1. converting a group of int items from decimal to binary or vice versa
    2. RPN calculators
